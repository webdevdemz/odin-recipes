        <p>Japchae (잡채; 雜菜) is a savory and slightly sweet dish of stir-fried 
            glass noodles and vegetables that is popular in Korean cuisine. 
            Japchae is typically prepared with dangmyeon (당면, 唐麵), a type of 
            cellophane noodles made from sweet potato starch; the noodles are 
            mixed with assorted vegetables, meat, mushrooms, and seasoned with 
            soy sauce and sesame oil. </p>

        <h2 class="subtitle">Ingredients</h2>

            <li>15g dried woodear mushrooms</li>
            <li>¼ cup water </li>
            <li>1 tbsp sesame seeds</li>
            <li>2 tbsp neutral oil</li>
        
            <li>¼ cup light soy sauce </li>
            <li>1 tbsp dark soy sauce</li>
            <li>2 tbsp sugar </li>
            <li>1 tbsp minced garlic</li>
            <li>2 tbsp balsamic vinegar (my secret sauce!)</li>
            <li>2 tbsp sesame oil </li>
            <li>1 tbsp neutral oil</li>
        </ul></div>

        <h2 class="subtitle">Steps</h2>
        <ol class="steps">
            <li>Soak the noodles in cold water for 2 hours until doubled in size. 
                You can also blanch the noodles according to package directions 
                and rinse under cold water to stop cooking further. Soak the 
                dried woodear mushrooms in water and 1 tsp of sugar as well.</li>
            <li>Heat a large skillet on high and drizzle neutral oil in a large 
                skillet.</li>
            <li>Sautee the vegetables on high heat until the onions are 
                translucent, but the vegetables are still crunchy. Make sure not 
                to overcrowd your pan-- if you think that you will overcrowd the 
                pan and steam the vegetables, sautee in batches.</li>
            <li>Set aside the sauteed vegetables.</li>
            <li>In the same pan, add the noodles, water, and sauce in.</li>
            <li>Simmer and stir-fry the noodles in sauce for one to two minutes 
                or until it takes on color. </li>
            <li>Add the sauteed vegetables and mushrooms. Mix.</li>
            <li>Garnish with sesame seeds. Enjoy!</li>
