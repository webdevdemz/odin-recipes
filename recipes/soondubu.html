        <p>This Soondubu Jjigae (Korean tofu stew) recipe is warm and soothing--
             perfect for a cozy night in, or for that hangover after a long night
             out and about. Loaded with soft, velvety tofu, vegetables, and your 
             protein(s) of choice, soondubu jjigae is the ultimate comfort food.</p>
        
        <p>Sizzling and overflowing with dried red chili pepper flakes on the side 
            like molten lava, you crack an egg in and gently spoon a blanket of the 
            hot broth over. You take a sip of the hot chili oil broth and it's an 
            immediate shock to your lethargic body: the spice rejuvenates you-- 
            the tingling sensation from the hot broth lingers on to help you power 
            through your day. You're then rewarded with a poached egg and you smash 
            it open with the back of your spoon and mix the broth and rice together. 
            Avocado toast for sunday brunch has got nothing on this. </p>

        <h2 class="subtitle">Ingredients</h2>
            <div><ul>
                <li>1 pack/ 350g of soondubu (silken tofu)</li> 
                <li>½ cup zucchini, thinly sliced</li>
                <li>1 scallion, thinly sliced</li>
                <li>½ cup clams or protein of choice</li>
                <li>1 egg </li>
                <li>½ -1 tbsp fish sauce (season to your liking)</li>
                <li>¼ tsp sesame oil</li>
                <li>150mL water* (should only come up to 20% height of your pot)</li>
            
                <li>½ onion, finely diced </li>
                <li>2 scallions, thinly sliced</li>
                <li>1 clove of garlic, finely diced</li>
                <li>⅓ cup neutral oil </li>
                <li>3 tbsp gochugaru (Korean chili flakes)</li>
                <li>1 tsp fish sauce </li>
                <li>1 tbsp soy sauce</li>
            </ul></div>

        <h2 class="subtitle">Steps</h2>
            <ol class="steps">
                <li>Add your chopped onion, scallions, garlic, oil to a pot.</li>
                <li>Bring the heat to a medium-low. </li>
                <li>Once the oil comes up to temperature, bring it to a medium-low 
                    and cook until caramelized. We’re infusing the oil with the 
                    aromatics so low and slow is best! This process should take 
                    around 20 minutes for the best caramelization.</li>
                <li>Once the paste has caramelized to a golden brown color, 
                    drizzle the soy sauce and let it slightly burn. This is to 
                    add to the aroma and the umami. Add the fish sauce in as well. 
                    [If you’re putting in meat for your soondubu, this is a good 
                    time to add it and cook out the meat to get it browned and 
                    crispy]</li>
                <li>Add the gochugaru. Toast the gochugaru in the oil. The oil 
                    should turn bright red. </li>
                <li>Once the gochugaru has toasted, transfer the paste into a 
                    separate bowl. The reason why we have a separate paste is to 
                    be able to adjust the spiciness to your liking.</li>
                <li>In an earthenware pot, add your water in. The water should 
                    only come to 20% otherwise your soondubu will overflow.</li>
                <li>On high heat, boil the water. Add the zucchini and scallions
                     and cook for 1 minute.</li>
                <li>Drop the clams or seafood into the veggie broth. </li>
                <li>Once the clams have opened, add your paste in.</li>
                <li>Season with fish sauce.</li>
                <li>Turn the heat off and enjoy with a cracked egg. The 
                    residual heat will poach the egg. Enjoy! </li>
            </ol>
