        <h4><em>Chocolate cookie dough</em></h4>
        <ul>
            <li>100g butter, room temperature</li>
            <li>100g sugar</li>
            <li>150g AP flour </li>
            <li>1 tbsp cocoa powder</li>
            <li>1 tsp baking powder</li>
            <li>1 tsp salt </li>
            <li>1 egg</li>
            <li>1 tsp vanilla extract</li>
            <li>Semi sweet 70% dark chocolate or nuts of your choice</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven at 180C / 355F</li>
            <li>In a medium sized bowl, add room temperature butter and sugar. 
                Whisk until smooth and slighitly fluffy.</li>
            <li>Add the vanilla extract and crack 1 egg into the mixture. Whisk 
                until combined. </li>
            <li>Sift in flour, baking powder, matcha and salt. </li>
            <li>Mix until there are no dry spots. </li>
            <li>Repeat the process for the chocolate cookie dough.</li>
            <li>The dough should feel slightly wetter than normal cookie dough. 
                This allows the cookies to be slightly crispy on the outside but 
                ooey-gooey on the inside. </li>
            <li>Using a icecream scooper, scoop Â½ tbsp of the matcha dough in 
                first on one side.</li>
            <li>Fill the rest with chocolate cookie dough. At this point, if you 
                want a more marbled effect, use a toothpick to swirl along the 
                where the two doughs meet. </li>
            <li>Dollop the cookie mixture into a parchment lined baking tray. 
                Make sure to have ample space inbetween the cookies!! My first 
                batch was way too close and it ended up becoming attached to each 
                other. Rest the batter in the fridge for 30 minutes. </li>
            <li>Bake at 180C / 355F for 12-15 minutes, depending on how you like 
                your cookies-- super gooey or slightly crispy!</li>
        </ol>
